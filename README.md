## TODO

1. Hosts query in server.js returns all docs. It should return only aggregate result
2. Add icons for pause and go-live - not applicable - moved to buttons
3. Add support for page scroll up - fix scroll bar issue
4. Format multi-line logs
5. Saved search feature
6. Host select option similar to current papertrailapp - done
7. Some times when there are too many events being generated live tail will show duplicate log events
8. show no events error message - done
9. fix issue with searchbar going up when kibana sidebar is clicked
10. fix issue with time search - need to move scrollbar to top
