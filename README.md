## TODO

1. Hosts query in server.js returns all docs. It should return only aggregate result
2. Add icons for pause and go-live
3. Add support for page scroll up - fix scroll bar issue
4. Format multi-line logs
5. Saved search feature
6. Host select option similar to current papertrailapp - done
7. Some times when there are too many events being generated live tail will show duplicate log events
